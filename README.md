# Text Organizer Web Application

This project is a full-stack web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Flask as the backend, and integrates a Machine Learning model. The aim of the application is to take a text file as input and organize its information.

## Features

- **Text File Input:** Users can upload a text file containing unstructured information.
- **ML Model Integration:** The application incorporates a Machine Learning model that processes the text file and identifies sections to create subheadings.
- **Dynamic Interface:** The frontend provides a user-friendly interface that dynamically displays the organized content.
- **Flask Backend:** The backend, built with Flask, handles file uploads, interacts with the ML model, and serves processed data to the frontend.
